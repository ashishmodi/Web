Search engine uses meta description for result rankings and to display relavant info. Also it uses alt attribute for the same purpose.
Form action could be mailto as well:
Goto Chrome -> settings -> privacy -> site settings -> permission -> additional permission -> protocol handlers -> sites allowed to handle protocols -> restart gmail. Now in the address bar, you will be able to see "Allow Gmail to open all email links."
Even if you don't write style attribute explicitly, there is still default css which applies for browser.
id vs class: Unlike class, you can only have 1 instance of id in a single page. Also you can have more than one class for a particular element, but you cannot have more than one id.
Use favicon.cc for icon.
<p> is block element i.e. color applies to entire line even in blank space.
Certain properties doesn't work with span which works with <p>, like you can't set width: 100px in css for span.
display: none can be used in an application like quiz to hide certain elements. visibility: hidden also does the same thing, but it keeps position of all other elements as it is.
